# EulerPath
Euler Path algorithm for both directed and undirected graphs.

Includes a more structured graph hierarchy with separated directed and undirected graph implementations, than it was in DijkstraAlgorithm. Random generator was update regarding to new graph structures. Functions for checking whether the graph has an Euler Path are implemented.
